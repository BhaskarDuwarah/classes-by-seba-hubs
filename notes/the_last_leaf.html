            ‚ÄúThe Last Leaf‚Äù by O. Henry is a story about hope, sacrifice, and friendship. Sue and Johnsy are two young artists living together.

Behrman, an old artist, secretly paints a realistic leaf on the wall during a stormy night to give Johnsy hope. The leaf never falls, and Johnsy recovers. Sadly, Behrman catches pneumonia while painting the leaf and dies. His sacrifice saves Johnsy‚Äôs life.
