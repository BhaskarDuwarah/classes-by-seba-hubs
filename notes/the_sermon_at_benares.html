        <h2>📜 6 Long Answer Questions (5 Marks)</h2>
<div class="qna">
    <p><strong>Q1 (5 Marks):</strong> Narrate the story of Kisa Gotami and explain the moral lesson it conveys.</p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong> Kisa Gotami was a young woman whose only child had died. Overcome with grief, she went from house to house begging for medicine to bring her child back to life. People thought she had lost her senses, but one kind man sent her to Gautama Buddha. Buddha told her to bring a handful of mustard seeds from a house where no one had died. Kisa Gotami eagerly went searching, but in every house, she found someone had lost a loved one. Gradually, she realized that death is universal, and no one can escape it. She understood that grieving cannot bring back the dead. The moral lesson is that acceptance of life’s impermanence leads to peace. Clinging to sorrow prolongs suffering, while letting go helps heal the heart.</p>

    <p><strong>Q2 (5 Marks):</strong> How did Gautama Buddha’s life experiences shape his teachings?</p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong> Gautama Buddha was born as Siddhartha Gautama into a royal family, surrounded by luxury. However, at age 29, he saw sickness, old age, and death, which deeply disturbed him. Realizing that wealth and comfort could not protect one from life’s suffering, he left his palace in search of truth. After years of meditation and hardship, he attained enlightenment under the Bodhi tree. His teachings reflect his personal journey—he taught that desire and attachment cause suffering, and detachment leads to peace. Buddha’s own experiences made him compassionate towards others’ suffering and inspired his message of universal love and acceptance.</p>

    <p><strong>Q3 (5 Marks):</strong> Explain Buddha’s concept of suffering and how it applies to modern life.</p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong> Buddha taught that life is full of suffering caused by desire and attachment. We suffer when we lose loved ones or material possessions because of our attachment to them. He suggested that to overcome suffering, we must understand life’s impermanence and detach from worldly desires. In modern life, people face stress, grief, and anxiety due to similar attachments—relationships, wealth, and ambitions. Buddha’s philosophy remains relevant as it encourages mindfulness, acceptance, and inner peace in today’s fast-paced world. Practicing detachment doesn’t mean indifference but understanding that nothing lasts forever, helping us live with balance and compassion.</p>

    <p><strong>Q4 (5 Marks):</strong> What is the significance of Buddha’s first sermon at Benares?</p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong> Buddha’s first sermon at Benares is significant because it marked the beginning of his teaching journey after enlightenment. In this sermon, he introduced the concept of the Middle Path, avoiding extremes of luxury and self-denial. He emphasized that suffering is a part of life and taught the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path as a way to end suffering. The story of Kisa Gotami was used to illustrate that grief and death are universal. This sermon laid the foundation of Buddhism and inspired millions to follow a life of wisdom, ethical conduct, and mental discipline.</p>

    <p><strong>Q5 (5 Marks):</strong> How does “The Sermon at Benares” teach the value of detachment and acceptance?</p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong> The story shows that attachment to worldly things and people causes suffering. Kisa Gotami’s grief over her dead child represents this attachment. Her realization that death spares no one helped her accept life’s impermanence. Buddha taught that only by letting go of such attachments can one achieve peace and enlightenment. Acceptance allows individuals to live without fear of loss. Detachment doesn’t mean abandoning love but understanding the temporary nature of life. This teaching helps people today deal with loss, disappointment, and change with strength and wisdom.</p>

    <p><strong>Q6 (5 Marks):</strong> What relevance do Buddha’s teachings hold for today’s generation?</p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong> Buddha’s teachings remain highly relevant today. In a world full of stress, materialism, and emotional struggles, his philosophy offers a path to inner peace.
