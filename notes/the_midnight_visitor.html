<div class="qna">
    <p><strong>Q1 (5 Marks):</strong> How did Ausable defeat Max without using a weapon? Explain his strategy in detail.</p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong> Ausable, despite being unarmed, defeated Max using intelligence and quick thinking. He fabricated a story about a balcony outside his window, saying intruders had used it earlier. When the waiter knocked at the door, Ausable claimed it was the police checking for security. Max, holding a gun, panicked and decided to escape through the “balcony.” Believing Ausable’s calm lies, Max jumped and fell to his death because the balcony didn’t exist. Ausable’s presence of mind turned a dangerous situation into a victory without any physical confrontation.</p>

    <p><strong>A:</strong> Ausable’s calmness, intelligence, and presence of mind define him as an ideal secret agent. Unlike the typical action hero, he relies on mental strength.

Ausable’s ability to manipulate situations in his favor without violence shows that true strength in espionage lies in quick thinking and clever strategies.</p>

    <p><strong>Q3 (5 Marks):</strong> Discuss the theme of intelligence versus physical strength in “The Midnight Visitor.”</p>

    <p><strong>Q4 (5 Marks):</strong> What role does irony play in “The Midnight Visitor”?</p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong> Irony is central to the story. Max, armed and confident, dies not in a fight but because of a fabricated balcony and his own panic.
