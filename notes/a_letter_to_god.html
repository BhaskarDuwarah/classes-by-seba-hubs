        <h2>üìú 6 Long Answer Questions (5 Marks)</h2>
<div class="qna">
    <p><strong>Q1:</strong> Discuss the themes of faith, kindness, and irony in ‚ÄúA Letter to God.‚Äù</p>
    <p><strong>A1:</strong> 
        The story beautifully weaves three major themes: faith, kindness, and irony. Lencho‚Äôs faith in God is unshakable. Even after his crops are destroyed, he writes a letter to God with confidence that his prayer will be answered. The kindness of the postmaster and his staff shines when they collect money to help Lencho, preserving his faith. However, the dramatic irony occurs when Lencho, instead of appreciating human effort, blames the post office employees for stealing part of God‚Äôs money. This blend of innocence and misunderstanding makes the story touching and thought-provoking. It shows how pure faith can exist alongside human goodness and also highlights the gap between perception and reality. The message is that true kindness often goes unrecognized, yet it strengthens the hope of those in despair.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Q2:</strong> Write a character sketch of Lencho highlighting his strengths and weaknesses.</p>
    <p><strong>A2:</strong>
        Lencho is a simple, hardworking farmer who depends on his crops for survival. His greatest strength is his deep faith in God; he believes God sees everything and helps those in need. His optimism and resilience are admirable as he does not lose hope even after losing his harvest. However, his blind faith becomes a weakness. He is naive and fails to recognize human kindness. When he receives less money than he requested, he immediately assumes dishonesty among the post office staff. This shows his innocence but also his lack of awareness about the real world. Lencho‚Äôs character represents the purity of belief and the struggles of rural farmers, making him relatable and memorable.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Q3:</strong> How does the story reflect the struggles of rural farmers?</p>
    <p><strong>A3:</strong>
        ‚ÄúA Letter to God‚Äù highlights the vulnerability of rural farmers. Lencho‚Äôs livelihood depends entirely on his crops, and a single hailstorm destroys his hard work and hope. This reflects how natural disasters can devastate farming communities that lack insurance or financial support. The story also portrays the emotional toll on farmers when they face such losses, as seen in Lencho‚Äôs desperate appeal to God. It raises awareness about their dependence on weather and the absence of social safety nets. The tale also hints at the resilience of farmers who, despite setbacks, are ready to start over with hope and faith. It emphasizes the need for empathy and support for such communities.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Q4:</strong> Write a diary entry as Lencho after receiving God‚Äôs ‚Äúhelp.‚Äù</p>
    <p><strong>A4:</strong>
        *‚ÄúDear Diary,*<br>
        *Today my faith in God grew stronger. He sent me 70 pesos to start anew. My crops will flourish again, and my family will not go hungry. But I am hurt that some dishonest people at the post office stole 30 pesos from God‚Äôs gift. Tomorrow I will write another letter to God, asking Him not to send money through these people. I trust God‚Äôs mercy completely. With His help, I will overcome every storm.‚Äù*
    </p>

    <p><strong>Q5:</strong> Analyze the role of the postmaster in preserving Lencho‚Äôs faith.</p>
    <p><strong>A5:</strong>
        The postmaster plays a crucial role in the story. Initially amused by Lencho‚Äôs letter, he later feels moved by the farmer‚Äôs innocence and unwavering faith. To preserve this faith, he collects money from his colleagues and sends it anonymously. This act of kindness and empathy reflects true humanity. The postmaster‚Äôs efforts highlight how small acts of generosity can restore hope and belief in others. Even though Lencho misjudges the helpers, the postmaster‚Äôs selfless deed remains a shining example of compassion and moral responsibility. He embodies the unseen ‚Äúangels‚Äù in our world who work silently to help others.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Q6:</strong> What message does ‚ÄúA Letter to God‚Äù convey to the readers?</p>
    <p><strong>A6:</strong>
        The story sends a powerful message about faith, kindness, and human nature. It shows that faith can give people strength in the face of adversity. It also highlights the beauty of selfless kindness, as shown by the postmaster and his staff. At the same time, the story warns against blind faith that ignores human efforts. The irony of Lencho blaming his helpers teaches readers to be more observant and grateful. Overall, it reminds us that while faith in God is important, recognizing and appreciating the goodness of people around us is equally vital.
