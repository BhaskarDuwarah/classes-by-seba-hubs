        <h2>üìñ Summary</h2>
        <p>
            Isaac Asimov's ‚ÄúThe Fun They Had‚Äù is set in 2157 where schools no longer exist as we know them today. Children learn at home using mechanical teachers. Margie and Tommy, two such children, find a real book about old schools and are fascinated by the idea of students learning together in classrooms, with human teachers. Margie realizes that old schools must have been fun and full of interaction, something she misses in her robotic learning environment.
