        <h2>üìñ Summary</h2>
        <p>
            The chapter "Periodic Classification of Elements" discusses the historical development of classification systems for elements and explains how the modern periodic table came into existence. Starting from D√∂bereiner‚Äôs triads to Newlands‚Äô law of octaves, it details Mendeleev‚Äôs periodic law which states that properties of elements are periodic functions of their atomic masses. Later, Henry Moseley corrected this by proposing the modern periodic law: properties of elements are periodic functions of their atomic numbers. The chapter also explains the structure of the modern periodic table, including groups, periods, and trends such as valency, atomic size, metallic and non-metallic character, and electronegativity across periods and groups.

            <div class="qna">
    <p><strong>Q1 (2 Marks):</strong> Why did Mendeleev leave gaps in his periodic table?</p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong> Mendeleev left gaps in his table because he predicted the existence and properties of undiscovered elements like gallium and germanium.</p>

    <p><strong>Q2 (2 Marks):</strong> State two limitations of Mendeleev‚Äôs periodic table.</p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong>  
    1. Position of isotopes was not explained.<br>
    2. Some elements were placed in incorrect order based on atomic masses (e.g., cobalt and nickel).</p>

    <p><strong>Q3 (2 Marks):</strong> Define modern periodic law and explain its significance.</p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong> Modern periodic law states: ‚ÄúProperties of elements are periodic functions of their atomic numbers.‚Äù It corrected flaws of Mendeleev‚Äôs table and arranged elements logically.</p>

    <p><strong>Q4 (2 Marks):</strong> What are groups and periods in the periodic table?</p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong> Groups are vertical columns (18 total), and periods are horizontal rows (7 total) in the modern periodic table.</p>

    <p><strong>Q5 (2 Marks):</strong> Why does atomic size decrease across a period?</p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong> Atomic size decreases because nuclear charge increases, pulling electrons closer to the nucleus.</p>

    <p><strong>Q6 (2 Marks):</strong> Why does atomic size increase down a group?</p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong> Atomic size increases because new electron shells are added down the group, increasing the distance between nucleus and outermost electrons.</p>

    <p><strong>Q7 (2 Marks):</strong> What is meant by periodicity? Name two periodic properties.</p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong> Periodicity is the repetition of properties of elements at regular intervals in the periodic table. Examples: Atomic radius and electronegativity.</p>

    <p><strong>Q8 (2 Marks):</strong> Write two reasons why noble gases are placed in Group 18.</p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong>  
    1. They have completely filled valence shells.<br>
    2. They are chemically inert (do not react easily).</p>

    <p><strong>Q9 (2 Marks):</strong> Define valency. How does it vary across a period?</p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong> Valency is the combining capacity of an element. Across a period, valency first increases from 1 to 4, then decreases back to 0 in noble gases.</p>

    <p><strong>Q10 (2 Marks):</strong> State two differences between Mendeleev‚Äôs and Modern periodic tables.</p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong>  
    1. Mendeleev: Based on atomic mass; Modern: Based on atomic number.<br>
    2. Mendeleev‚Äôs table had gaps for undiscovered elements; Modern table is complete.</p>

    <p><strong>Q11 (2 Marks):</strong> Why do metallic characters increase down a group?</p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong> Metallic character increases because atoms can lose electrons more easily due to larger atomic size and lower effective nuclear charge down the group.</p>

    <p><strong>Q12 (2 Marks):</strong> What happens to non-metallic character across a period? Why?</p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong> Non-metallic character increases because nuclear charge increases, making it easier for atoms to gain electrons.</p>

    <p><strong>Q13 (2 Marks):</strong> Which has greater metallic character: Sodium or Potassium? Why?</p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong> Potassium has greater metallic character because it is below sodium in Group 1 and can lose electrons more easily due to larger atomic size.</p>

    <p><strong>Q14 (2 Marks):</strong> State two reasons why hydrogen is placed separately in the periodic table.</p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong>  
    1. It resembles alkali metals by losing 1 electron.<br>
    2. It also resembles halogens by gaining 1 electron.</p>

    <p><strong>Q1 (3‚Äì4 Marks):</strong> Write four differences between Mendeleev‚Äôs and Modern periodic tables.</p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong>  
    1. Basis: Mendeleev ‚Äì Atomic mass; Modern ‚Äì Atomic number.<br>
    2. Gaps: Mendeleev left gaps for undiscovered elements; Modern has no gaps.<br>
    3. Isotopes: Mendeleev could not explain them; Modern places isotopes correctly.<br>
    4. Noble gases: Absent in Mendeleev‚Äôs table; Present in Group 18 of Modern table.</p>

    <p><strong>Q2 (3‚Äì4 Marks):</strong> Explain trends in metallic and non-metallic character across a period and down a group.</p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong>  
    - Across a period: Metallic character decreases, non-metallic character increases due to increased nuclear charge.<br>
    - Down a group: Metallic character increases because outer electrons are farther from the nucleus and more easily lost.</p>

    <p><strong>Q3 (3‚Äì4 Marks):</strong> Describe how atomic size changes across a period and down a group. Give reasons.</p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong>  
    - Across a period: Atomic size decreases due to increasing nuclear charge pulling electrons closer.<br>
    - Down a group: Atomic size increases because new electron shells are added, increasing distance from the nucleus.</p>

    <p><strong>Q4 (3‚Äì4 Marks):</strong> What is periodicity? Explain with two examples.</p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong> Periodicity is the repetition of properties of elements at regular intervals in the periodic table.<br>
    Examples:<br>
    1. Ionization energy increases across a period.<br>
    2. Atomic size increases down a group.</p>

    <p><strong>Q5 (3‚Äì4 Marks):</strong> State Modern Periodic Law and give its advantages over Mendeleev‚Äôs law.</p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong> Modern Periodic Law: ‚ÄúProperties of elements are periodic functions of their atomic numbers.‚Äù<br>
    Advantages:<br>
    1. Correct placement of isotopes.<br>
    2. Removal of anomalies of Mendeleev‚Äôs table.<br>
    3. Clear explanation of periodic trends.</p>

    <p><strong>Q6 (3‚Äì4 Marks):</strong> Write the electronic configurations of Na (Z=11), Mg (Z=12), and Cl (Z=17). Identify their periods and groups.</p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong>  
    Na: 2,8,1 ‚Äì Period 3, Group 1<br>
    Mg: 2,8,2 ‚Äì Period 3, Group 2<br>
    Cl: 2,8,7 ‚Äì Period 3, Group 17</p>

    <p><strong>Q7 (3‚Äì4 Marks):</strong> Why are noble gases placed in Group 18? Explain with examples.</p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong> Noble gases have completely filled valence shells, making them chemically inert.<br>
    Examples: Helium (2 electrons), Neon (8 electrons). Both are stable and do not react easily.</p>

    <p><strong>Q8 (3‚Äì4 Marks):</strong> Explain how valency varies across a period and down a group.</p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong>  
    - Across a period: Valency increases from 1 to 4, then decreases back to 0.<br>
    - Down a group: Valency remains the same because elements in the same group have the same number of valence electrons.</p>

    <p><strong>Q9 (3‚Äì4 Marks):</strong> Explain why metallic character increases down a group but decreases across a period.</p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong>  
    - Down a group: Outer electrons are farther from the nucleus and more easily lost, increasing metallic character.<br>
    - Across a period: Increased nuclear charge holds electrons more tightly, reducing metallic character.</p>

    <p><strong>Q10 (3‚Äì4 Marks):</strong> Draw a simplified modern periodic table showing only Groups 1, 2, and 18, and Periods 1 to 3. Place H, He, Na, Mg, Cl.</p>

    <p><strong>Q1:</strong> Why did Mendeleev arrange elements in increasing order of atomic mass and not atomic number?</p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong> Atomic number was not known during Mendeleev‚Äôs time. He used atomic mass to arrange elements and found periodicity in their properties.</p>

    <p><strong>Q2:</strong> Define Modern Periodic Law.</p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong> Modern Periodic Law states: ‚ÄúProperties of elements are periodic functions of their atomic numbers.‚Äù</p>

    <p><strong>Q3:</strong> Why is lithium placed in Group 1 and Period 2?</p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong> Lithium has one valence electron (Group 1) and two shells (Period 2).</p>

    <p><strong>Q4:</strong> Write the electronic configuration of oxygen (Z=8). Which period and group does it belong to?</p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong> Configuration: 2,6; Period: 2; Group: 16.</p>

    <p><strong>Q5:</strong> State any two limitations of Mendeleev‚Äôs periodic table.</p>
