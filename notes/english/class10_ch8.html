        <h2>üìñ Summary</h2>
        <p>
            This chapter explains how organisms reproduce to maintain their species. It covers both asexual (binary fission, budding, fragmentation) and sexual reproduction in plants and animals. Important topics include the reproductive systems of humans, menstrual cycle, pollination, and fertilization. Diagrams are essential for understanding concepts like the human reproductive system and parts of a flower.

        <h2>‚ú® 10 Medium Answer Questions (3‚Äì4 Marks)</h2>
<div class="qna">
    <p><strong>Q1:</strong> Explain the process of fertilization in flowering plants with a diagram.</p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong>  
    Fertilization occurs when a pollen grain reaches the stigma, germinates, and the pollen tube grows through the style to reach the ovary. The male gamete fuses with the egg cell to form a zygote.  
    (Diagram of fertilization in flowers recommended.)</p>

    <p><strong>Q2:</strong> Describe the human male reproductive system with a neat labelled diagram.</p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong>  
    It consists of testes (produce sperm and testosterone), vas deferens (transports sperm), seminal vesicles (produce seminal fluid), urethra (conveys sperm and urine).  
    (Diagram of male reproductive system required.)</p>

    <p><strong>Q3:</strong> Write differences between binary fission, multiple fission, and budding with examples.</p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong>  
    - Binary fission: One cell splits into two (e.g., Amoeba).  
    - Multiple fission: One cell splits into many daughter cells (e.g., Plasmodium).  
    - Budding: A new organism grows from a bud (e.g., Hydra).</p>

    <p><strong>Q4:</strong> Explain vegetative propagation with two examples. Why is it useful?</p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong>  
    It is reproduction using vegetative parts (like stems or leaves). Examples:  
    - Potato (stem tuber)  
    - Bryophyllum (leaf buds).  
    Useful because it produces clones and allows propagation without seeds.</p>

    <p><strong>Q5:</strong> Describe the role of placenta during pregnancy.</p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong>  
    The placenta connects mother and embryo. It allows exchange of nutrients, oxygen, and wastes. It also produces hormones for maintaining pregnancy.</p>

    <p><strong>Q6:</strong> How does DNA copying during reproduction contribute to variations? Why are variations important?</p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong>  
    DNA copying is not always perfect and introduces small changes. Variations help organisms survive changes in the environment and promote evolution.</p>

    <p><strong>Q7:</strong> Draw and label the human female reproductive system. Briefly explain its parts.</p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong>  
    The system includes ovaries (produce eggs), fallopian tubes (site of fertilization), uterus (embryo development), vagina (birth canal).  
    (Diagram of female reproductive system recommended.)</p>

    <p><strong>Q8:</strong> Explain cross-pollination and self-pollination with examples. Which is better and why?</p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong>  
    - Self-pollination: Pollen transferred within same flower (e.g., peas).  
    - Cross-pollination: Pollen transferred between flowers of same species (e.g., maize).  
    Cross-pollination is better as it promotes genetic variation.</p>

    <p><strong>Q9:</strong> What are sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)? Name two bacterial and two viral STDs.</p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong>  
    STDs are infections transmitted through sexual contact.  
    - Bacterial: Syphilis, Gonorrhea.  
    - Viral: AIDS (HIV), Genital herpes.</p>

    <p><strong>Q10:</strong> How is the embryo protected inside the mother‚Äôs womb?</p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong>  
    The embryo is embedded in the uterine wall and surrounded by amniotic fluid, which cushions it against shocks and protects from desiccation and infections.</p>

        <h2>üåü 5 Long Answer Questions (5 Marks)</h2>
<div class="qna">
    <p><strong>Q1:</strong> Explain the process of reproduction in flowering plants with a neat labelled diagram.</p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong>  
    The reproductive parts of a flower are the stamen (male) and carpel (female). The process includes:  
    1. Pollination ‚Äì Transfer of pollen grains from anther to stigma.  
    2. Germination ‚Äì Pollen grain germinates and forms a pollen tube.  
    3. Fertilization ‚Äì Male gametes fuse with egg cell in ovule.  
    4. Seed and Fruit Formation ‚Äì Fertilized ovule develops into seed; ovary develops into fruit.  
    (Diagram of a flower showing anther, stigma, pollen tube recommended.)</p>

    <p><strong>Q2:</strong> Describe the human male and female reproductive systems with labelled diagrams. Explain how they function together for reproduction.</p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong>  
    - Male reproductive system: Testes (produce sperm), vas deferens (transport), seminal vesicles, urethra.  
    - Female reproductive system: Ovaries (produce ova), fallopian tubes (site of fertilization), uterus (embryo development).  
    - During reproduction, sperm is deposited in vagina, travels to fallopian tube, fertilizes ovum forming zygote which implants in uterus.  
    (Diagrams of both systems required.)</p>

    <p><strong>Q3:</strong> What is asexual reproduction? Describe five types with examples.</p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong>  
    Asexual reproduction involves a single parent and no gamete fusion. Types:  
    1. Binary Fission (Amoeba)  
    2. Multiple Fission (Plasmodium)  
    3. Budding (Hydra)  
    4. Fragmentation (Spirogyra)  
    5. Vegetative Propagation (Potato, Bryophyllum).  
    (Draw binary fission in Amoeba and budding in Hydra for clarity.)</p>

    <p><strong>Q4:</strong> Explain the menstrual cycle in humans. Why is it important for reproduction?</p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong>  
    Menstrual cycle is a 28-day cycle involving:  
    - Follicle growth and ovum release (ovulation around day 14).  
    - Thickening of uterine lining for possible implantation.  
    - If fertilization fails, the lining sheds (menstruation).  
    Importance: Prepares uterus for pregnancy each month.</p>

    <p><strong>Q5:</strong> What are sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)? Explain their causes, symptoms, prevention, and why they are a threat to reproductive health.</p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong>  
    STDs are infections spread by sexual contact.  
    - Causes: Bacteria (syphilis, gonorrhea), viruses (HIV/AIDS, herpes).  
    - Symptoms: Sores, discharge, infertility in severe cases.  
    - Prevention: Safe sex practices, awareness, early diagnosis.  
    Importance: They can damage reproductive organs and prevent conception.</p>
