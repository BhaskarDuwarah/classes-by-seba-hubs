        <h2>üìñ Exam-ready Summary</h2>
        <p>
            In the poem ‚ÄúAnimals,‚Äù Walt Whitman contrasts humans with animals. He admires animals for their simplicity, honesty, and contentment. Unlike humans, animals do not complain about their lives or chase materialistic desires. They live in harmony with nature, are self-sufficient, and show respect for all beings. Whitman believes humans have lost these qualities due to greed and hypocrisy. He wishes to learn from animals and regain the innocence and peace that humanity once possessed. The poem conveys a message of self-reflection and the importance of living a life in balance with nature.

<div class="qna">
    <p><strong>Q1 (5 Marks):</strong> Discuss how ‚ÄúThe Proposal‚Äù highlights the foolishness of humans.</p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong> ‚ÄúThe Proposal‚Äù by Anton Chekhov is a farcical comedy that humorously shows human foolishness. Lomov visits Natalya‚Äôs house to propose marriage, but instead of proposing, they start arguing about Oxen Meadows. Even when the quarrel is resolved, they argue again about whose dog is superior. Chubukov joins the disputes, making the situation more chaotic. Their inability to focus on the purpose of Lomov‚Äôs visit shows how ego and pride make people forget what truly matters. The play mocks society‚Äôs attitude towards marriage, treating it like a deal rather than a bond of love. Chekhov uses these exaggerated arguments to highlight how humans waste energy on trivial issues instead of resolving important matters sensibly.</p>

    <p><strong>Q2 (5 Marks):</strong> Describe the character of Lomov as revealed in the play.</p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong> Lomov is a hypochondriac, nervous, and overly formal. He suffers from palpitations and anxiety, which make him lose focus on his purpose. Though he intends to propose marriage to Natalya, he gets caught up in petty quarrels about property and dogs. His approach to marriage is practical rather than romantic; he sees it as a way to secure his future. Lomov‚Äôs inability to control his temper or stay calm under pressure shows his weakness. However, his persistence and eventual success in proposing display determination. Chekhov uses Lomov to highlight human flaws like pride and foolishness in relationships.</p>

    <p><strong>Q3 (5 Marks):</strong> How is marriage portrayed in ‚ÄúThe Proposal‚Äù?</p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong> In ‚ÄúThe Proposal,‚Äù marriage is portrayed as a social and economic arrangement rather than a bond of love. Lomov wants to marry Natalya not out of affection but because she is a good housekeeper from a wealthy family. The constant quarrels between Lomov and Natalya over Oxen Meadows and their dogs further show how petty arguments overshadow the idea of companionship. Even Chubukov treats marriage as a practical deal. Chekhov uses humor and exaggeration to criticize the materialistic view of marriage in society. The play suggests that relationships built on convenience and ego are fragile and absurd.</p>

    <p><strong>Q4 (5 Marks):</strong> Analyze the role of Chubukov in the play.</p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong> Chubukov, Natalya‚Äôs father, plays a dual role in ‚ÄúThe Proposal.‚Äù Initially, he appears welcoming and supportive of Lomov‚Äôs proposal. However, he quickly joins in the arguments over Oxen Meadows, calling Lomov names and worsening the situation. Later, when he realizes Lomov‚Äôs purpose, Chubukov becomes the mediator, forcing both Lomov and Natalya to accept the proposal. His behavior reflects human fickleness and self-interest. He wants the marriage for financial security but lacks the patience to handle conflicts maturely. Chekhov uses Chubukov to portray societal hypocrisy and the absurdity of adult behavior in important matters like marriage.</p>

    <p><strong>Q5 (5 Marks):</strong> What makes ‚ÄúThe Proposal‚Äù a farce? Give examples from the play.</p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong> ‚ÄúThe Proposal‚Äù is a farce because it uses exaggerated situations, silly arguments, and nervous characters to create humor. Lomov‚Äôs constant health complaints, fainting, and inability to propose because of trivial disputes are classic elements of farce. The arguments about Oxen Meadows and the superiority of dogs show how insignificant issues can escalate into chaos. Chubukov‚Äôs behavior‚Äîswitching from kindness to aggression and then back to peacemaking‚Äîadds to the absurdity. The proposal finally happens not out of love but because Chubukov forces the couple to stop fighting. Chekhov uses these elements to mock human pride and pettiness.</p>

    <p><strong>Q6 (5 Marks):</strong> What is the message of the play ‚ÄúThe Proposal‚Äù?</p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong> The play delivers a strong message about human behavior. It highlights how pride, ego, and materialism can ruin relationships and turn important life events into comical situations. Chekhov criticizes the societal view of marriage as a business deal rather than a bond of love.
